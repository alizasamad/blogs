# No internship? No problem! – building skills
----

## Welcome readers! If you’re reading this blog right now, you’re probably in the same boat as me– an internship-less boat. Not to worry! If you keep applying to internships, you’re bound to strike at least one… right? Of course, this could mean applying to anywhere between 100 or even 500 different companies without the guarantee of making it to the interview stage. While cold applying is one avenue that desperate college students, like myself, may take, some tips and tricks might make the process a little easier and less time-consuming for all of us. 

Let’s assume you are completely new to data science or data analytics. It is extremely frustrating to see internships with requirements like “3+ years of Tableau experience” or “demonstrates proficiency in Python (Django, Pandas).” And, if you are like me, you apply for these internships anyway knowing that your resume won’t even make it past the first stage. 

Sure, college classes teach us how to use some of these tools, but that barely scratches the surface of what hiring managers expect from interns. The only way to get in-depth knowledge of data analysis tools is through application. And what better application is there than an internship? Unfortunately, data analyst internships are highly competitive, so applicants who already demonstrate technical proficiency will overshadow beginner-level applicants. There’s just no winning.

Or is there?

Internships are one of the most common ways to build technical skills and gain professional experience. However, they are not the only way. As a beginner myself, I have spent hours scouring the internet and asking Chat GPT for various sources that any data analyst or scientist can use to start developing key skills. The result: a beautiful compilation of my top resources to use!
