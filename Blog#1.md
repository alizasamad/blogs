# No Internship? No Problem!

Welcome readers! If you’re reading this blog, you’re probably in the same boat as me– an internship-less boat. Not to worry! If you keep applying to internships, you’re bound to strike at least one… right? Of course, this could mean applying to anywhere between 100 or even 500 different companies without the guarantee of making it to the interview stage. While cold applying is one avenue that desperate college students, like myself, may take, some tips and tricks might make the process a little easier and less time-consuming for all of us. 

Let’s assume you are completely new to data science or data analytics. It is extremely frustrating to see internships with requirements like “3+ years of Tableau experience” or “demonstrates proficiency in Python (Django, Pandas).” And, if you are like me, you apply for these internships anyway knowing that your resume won’t even make it past the first stage. 

Sure, college classes teach us how to use some of these tools, but that barely scratches the surface of what hiring managers expect from interns. The only way to get in-depth knowledge of data analysis tools is through application. And what better application is there than an internship? Unfortunately, data analyst internships are highly competitive, so applicants who already demonstrate technical proficiency will overshadow beginner-level applicants. There’s just no winning.

Or is there?

Internships are one of the most common ways to build technical skills and gain professional experience. However, they are not the only way. As a beginner myself, I have spent hours scouring the internet and asking Chat GPT for various sources that any data analyst or scientist can use to start developing key skills. The result: a beautiful compilation of my top resources to use!

## [1. Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

![Kaggle Logo](https://jonascleveland.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/kaggles.webp)

First up is Kaggle. This site is one of the most popular online tools data scientists use. You can find all sorts of datasets from fellow Kaggle users under the “Datasets” tab. 

> Check out this example: [Most Streamed Spotify Songs 2024](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/most-streamed-spotify-songs-2024).

If you can’t find a particular dataset, you can make and share your own for other Kagglers users to see. This will certainly be handy when looking for datasets to base personal projects. 

If you’re not ready to jump into projects just yet, don’t worry! Kaggle also has built-in tutorials on everything from basic Python syntax to Scikit Learn. These can be found under the “Learn” tab. 

> To get started, try out this 3-hour [Intro to Machine Learning](https://www.kaggle.com/learn/intro-to-machine-learning) course. 

Each course should only take a few hours and can help you gain valuable skills to jumpstart your data science career. 

The best way to learn is to practice. Once you get the hang of popular Python libraries and packages, try out the “Competition” feature on Kaggle. 

> Start with the [Titanic- Machine Learning From Disaster](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic) beginner competition. 

This is a great place to start for beginners since the sole intent of this competition is to learn. The Titanic Competition also has a tutorial that new machine learners can follow to understand Python’s Pandas and Scikit Learn packages. 

The best part about this competition is that it will run indefinitely, meaning you can continue to improve your program and increase your score as you gain a better understanding of machine learning. 

Once ready, experiment with other Kaggle competitions– they may even offer swag or cash prizes!


## [2. YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/)

> Luke Barousse, YouTube Content Creator

Another great resource is one that you may use almost everyday: YouTube! 

There are tons of content creators out there who share their experiences for free, so use that to your advantage. Videos range from explanations of what data analysts/scientists do to how to get internships in these fields. 

I’ve included a few videos from data science channels below that I’ve found helpful and may help you get started on your journey too!
  - [What To Do If You Don't Have An Internship](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4V6shQVmcGc) (Ranesh Guruparan)
  - [Build Perfect Data Analyst Portfolio (FASTEST Way)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TC6xYyO320E&list=WL&index=5) (Learn With Lukas)
  - [Top Courses to Become a Data Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqRxZSrJLEc&list=WL&index=6) (Luke Barousse)
  - [Scraping Data From a Real Website | Web Scraping in Python](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8dTpNajxaH0&list=WL&index=2) (Alex the Analyst)


## [3. Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/)

![Datacamp Image](https://www.datacamp.com/datacamp-socials-share.png)

Datacamp is a great tool for new data analysts/scientists to use! It is similar to Kaggle in that both resources allow users to develop skills through tutorials and projects. The only setback with this source is that if you want the full Datacamp experience, you need to pay a membership fee, unlike Kaggle which is completely free. 

Only the first chapter of each tutorial is free, but I found this helpful enough to get started. Personally, I prefer the Datacamp tutorials over the Kaggle ones. Try both and see what works best for you!

> To get started, here is a quick [Cleaning Data in Python tutorial](https://app.datacamp.com/learn/courses/cleaning-data-in-python).

Datacamp also has its own blog site, which I thought was pretty cool. In fact, that’s how I discovered this source since I used the following blog to get started on creating personal projects!

> Check out this blog: [20 Data Analytics Projects for All Levels](https://www.datacamp.com/blog/data-analytics-projects-all-levels?utm_source=google&utm_medium=paid_search&utm_campaignid=19589720830&utm_adgroupid=152984015494&utm_device=c&utm_keyword=&utm_matchtype=&utm_network=g&utm_adpostion=&utm_creative=684592141352&utm_targetid=dsa-2222697811438&utm_loc_interest_ms=&utm_loc_physical_ms=9032043&utm_content=DSA~blog~Data-Analysis&utm_campaign=230119_1-sea~dsa~tofu_2-b2c_3-us_4-prc_5-na_6-na_7-le_8-pdsh-go_9-nb-e_10-na_11-na&gad_source=1&gclid=CjwKCAjwqMO0BhA8EiwAFTLgIJsBhqc8E9NfeJkfNlt7q2Vo_NoT6axkgsoz_5lNoIRU1H3CdBWj6xoC3OgQAvD_BwE)

Finally, Datacamp has another cool resource that may come in handy when learning the syntax for different data tools like Python or Excel: cheat sheets. 

> Check out this cheat sheet: [MySQL Basics Cheat Sheet](https://www.datacamp.com/cheat-sheet/my-sql-basics-cheat-sheet)

There are still so many features of this source I have yet to discover, so let me know if you find anything interesting that you would like to share with me!


## 4. Certificates Galore!

![Coursera Image](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/D4D12AQHFNRDblsU1xQ/article-cover_image-shrink_600_2000/0/1677528528545?e=2147483647&v=beta&t=4m_zBymL0oPBiZ2FXqP66zoUzoAza5GkNdUOyM_nWGc)

One of the best ways to demonstrate to companies that you have the skills it takes to be a data analyst/scientist is by adding certificates to your resume. 

The previous source, [Datacamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), provides certificates of completion after each paid tutorial. However, if you are paying for a certificate, I highly recommend using [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/) instead. The cost for each course is about $49 (USD). 

In Luke Barousse’s [Top Courses to Become a Data Analyst](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqRxZSrJLEc&list=WL&index=6) video, he lists the various Coursera courses he recommends every beginner check out. I’ve listed them below for your convenience:
- [Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/google-data-analytics?irclickid=3EA3w3w%3AJxyKUfPUAuzeo2PBUkC29T0BIVVLSM0&irgwc=1&utm_medium=partners&utm_source=impact&utm_campaign=2946137&utm_content=b2c) (START WITH THIS ONE!)

If you have time, check out Luke’s video for an in-depth description of each course.

If this option is too expensive, no worries! Coursera also offers financial aid to those in need, which may help reduce the cost by just a little bit. 

If you are looking for a free certificate option, I have just the resource you need: [Great Learning](https://www.mygreatlearning.com/). These courses are great for those who want to get a better understanding of how to use tools like Excel, Tableau, and SQL. 

Unlike Coursera which is more hands-on, Great Learning Courses consist of a series of videos followed by a quiz which must be passed to receive the certificate. To get the most out of these courses, follow along with the instructor-led projects and take notes on the videos. Below is a list of Great Learning courses you can get started with:
- [SQL for Data Science](https://olympus.mygreatlearning.com/courses/40120)
- [Data Visualization in Tableau](https://olympus.mygreatlearning.com/courses/46844)
- [Python for Data Analysis](https://olympus.mygreatlearning.com/courses/47906)
- [Data Analytics with Excel](https://olympus.mygreatlearning.com/courses/82319)


## [5. GitHub](https://github.com/)

![GitHub Image](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1100/1*CWFkh5z8oa6dZfn5_gkKKQ.jpeg)

GitHub is a great platform for you to publish your completed projects. You can use GitHub to enhance your portfolio, build a website, and even write blogs. In the past months, I have used Github to do all three!

> Take a look at this video by Shaw Talebi that demonstrates [How to Make a Data Science Portfolio with GitHub Pages (2024)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D9CLhQdLp8w&list=WL&index=4).
> For more examples, feel free to visit my [portfolio website](https://alizasamad.github.io/). 

GitHub is also the perfect place for you to display your personal projects. You can include a description of each project in the README file so that other GitHub users know what features you used and how your program functions. 

For example, my very first project is a [web scraping program](https://github.com/alizasamad/IMDB_Web_Scraping_Project). I included a README that explains what the data is about, which Python libraries I used to gather the data, and where the data is from. The other files contain the Python code and the CSV file with the gathered data. 

Having your project workflow available for all to see helps employers know they can trust your work ethic and proves that you have the skills required to perform well. Make sure your repositories are public so that employers are able to see all your hard work! 


## [6. ChatGPT](https://openai.com/chatgpt/)
![ChatGPT Image](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/643c74f46dea0947e74b08e5/6454442a1adb284b602b2334_iStock-1463884479.jpg)

I know this may seem surprising, but ChatGPT is actually one of the best resources to use when starting out in any field. You can use ChatGPT to help you with project ideas, how to fix your code, and much more. 

Since I did not know how to use the Selenium library while web scraping from IMDB, ChatGPT helped me understand what I was missing in my code. I now have a better understanding of how my program functions and what to fix next time my program goes wrong.

I also used ChatGPT to help narrow down some resources I could use to enhance my data analysis skills. It led me to resources such as Kaggle tutorials and various YouTube channels that helped me understand how to use Pandas and Numpy.

Keep in mind that ChatGPT can also be exploited if you use it for the wrong reasons. Your ideas and code should be entirely your own– ChatGPT is meant only to guide you in the right direction. Copy-pasting code from ChatGPT is not your work and could be considered plagiarism.

I have only begun to touch the surface of data science and analytics, so I will be learning how to use these resources with you. Stay tuned for updates and more in-depth analyses of the tools listed above. For now, I wish you the best on your journey. Sit back, relax, and enjoy the learning process! Thanks for reading :)
